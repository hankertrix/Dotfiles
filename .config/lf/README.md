# Lf configuration files

## Lfrc
The `lfrc` file adds a few features to `lf`, listed below:

* File previewing using [ctpv](https://github.com/NikitaIvanovV/ctpv)
* Bulk renaming using [vimv](https://github.com/dmulholl/vimv)
* Creating files
* Making directories
* Moving around in the parent directory with J and K
* Warning about nested instances

## Colours
The `colors` file is to set the colours used in `lf`.

## Icons
The `icons` file is to set the icons used in `lf`. All the icons used are [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), so a [patched font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) is needed.

## Lfcd.sh file
This is just a file to create a new command called `lfcd` which is just `lf`, but it changes the directory when `lf` exits.

## External programs
