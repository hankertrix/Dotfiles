# Linux Config Files

The configuration files are located in `~/.config/`.

<br>

## i3

The i3 configuration is for the most part, the default configuration from EndeavourOS. There are only a few changes in the `~/.config/i3/config` to change the background, the terminal and the default utility to adjust the screen brightness.

<br>

## Neovim

There is a README.md file inside the `~/nvim/` folder that lists all of the plugins I use.

<br>

## Wezterm

For the most part, the wezterm configuration is just adding the Bluloco Light and Bluloco Dark colour scheme and setting the default colour scheme to Bluloco Dark. The default font has also been changed to use the [Cascadia Code Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/CascadiaCode).

<br>

## Kitty

Similarly, the kitty configuration is mostly just adding the Bluloco Dark colour scheme to kitty and changing the default font to [Cascadia Code Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/CascadiaCode). The auto update function for kitty has also been disabled.
